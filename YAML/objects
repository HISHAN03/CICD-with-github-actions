Objects in YAML

YAML has two top-level elements, an object (which consists of key-value pairs) 
and an array (which consists of an ordered set of values).
Keys can only be strings,
while values can be one of the following types:
object: a collection of key-value pairs. ... 
array: an ordered list of values, with a - preceding each item.
