Arrays in YAML

In YAML, Array represents a single key mapped to multiple values. 
Each value starts with a hyphen - symbol followed by space.


In YAML, you can represent an array of objects using a combination of lists and key-value pairs.
Here's an example of how you can create an array of objects in YAML:

- name: John
  age: 30
  occupation: Developer
- name: Alice
  age: 25
  occupation: Designer
- name: Bob
  age: 35
  occupation: Manager

In this example, we have an array of objects, where each object represents a person. Each person has properties like name, age, and occupation.
The hyphen (-) at the beginning of each block indicates that it is an element of the array.

Nested objects can also be represented within the array. Here's an example:
- name: John
  age: 30
  address:
    street: 123 Main St
    city: Anytown
- name: Alice
  age: 25
  address:
    street: 456 Elm St
    city: Otherville
