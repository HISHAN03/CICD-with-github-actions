In YAML, you can represent multiline strings using the literal style or folded style. 
Here's an example of each style:

1. Literal Style:

description: |
  This is a multiline string
  using the literal style.
  It preserves line breaks and
  leading/trailing white spaces.
  
  
  2. Folded Style:
  
   description: >
  This is a multiline string
  using the folded style.
  It removes line breaks and
  leading/trailing white spaces.
