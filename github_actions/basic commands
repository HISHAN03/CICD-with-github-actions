 Example of a simple YAML file that defines a GitHub Actions workflow
 
 this code is written in yaml file
 ..............................................................................................
 name: CI Workflow                                                

on:
  push:
    branches:
      - main

jobs:
  build:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    
    steps:
    - name: Checkout code
      uses: actions/checkout@v2
      
    - name: Set up Node.js
      uses: actions/setup-node@v2
      with:
        node-version: '14'
        
    - name: Install dependencies
      run: npm install
      
    - name: Run tests
      run: npm test
...............................................................................................

* The "name" field specifies the name of the workflow, which in this case is "CI Workflow".
* The "on" field defines the event that triggers the workflow. 
  In this example, the workflow is triggered on a push event to the main branch.
* The "jobs" section contains one or more jobs to be executed as part of the workflow. 
  In this case, there is a single job named "build(jobs are executed in asynchronous way)
* Under the build job, the runs-on field specifies the type of runner to use. 
  Here, we're using the "ubuntu-latest" runner, which runs the job on an Ubuntu-based virtual machine.
* Inside the "steps" field, each step represents a task to be executed. 
  The first step, named "Checkout code", uses the actions/checkout action to fetch the repository's code.
* The second step, named "Set up Node.js", uses the actions/setup-node action to set up the Node.js environment. 
  We specify the version of Node.js to use as '14'.
* The next step, "Install dependencies", runs the npm install command to install the project's dependencies.

Finally, the "Run tests" step executes the npm test command to run the project's tests.
